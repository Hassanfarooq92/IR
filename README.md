## Description:

This repository uses three datasets from UCI dateset repository for text classification using Naive Bayes, Rocchio (Nearest Centroid) and K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. 

## Datasets:

 The following Datasets were used:
 
1. [Sentence Classification Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentence+Classification)

2. [DBWorld e-mails Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/DBWorld+e-mails#)

3. [NIPS Conference Papers 1987-2015 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/NIPS+Conference+Papers+1987-2015)

## Relevant Papers:

The papers relevant to the datasets provide insights into the datasets:

## Directory Structure and Implementation:

The repository is arranged according to datasets and their .py code. The codes were run with Jupyter Notebook. The major Python libraries used are nlkt, sklearn and scikit-learn.
